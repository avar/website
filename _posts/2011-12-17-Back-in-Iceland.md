I'm back in Iceland for the holidays, I'm staying for a few days in
Reykjavík before moving on to Akureyri. I haven't been in Reykjavík
for more than a couple of days for years.

Observations for the first few hours, in no particular order:

 * Icelandic customs welcomed me with a search of my luggage. It
   happens 1/3 times I come here, never happens in Europe. One of the
   reasons I think this is a somewhat crappy country to live
   in. "Welcome home, fuck you!"

 * Nobody told me that wearing vintage 1920 hats and growing a beard
   was now fashionable among the arty types in 101 Reykjavík, but it
   now is. What'll they think of next?
   
 * A common beer costs ~5 EUR at a pub/restaurant. If you're not
   getting paid in EUR that's more like 10 EUR. Murder!
   
 * You can't get beer in this country at anything but obscene prices
   except in the government run store. I know this intellectually, but
   it takes a while to get used to every time.
   
 * I had forgotten what an actual shower felt like after living in
   Amsterdam for a while. The showers here aren't just like a warm
   version of standing out in the rain. They're hot and the water
   actually streams out of the showerhead.
   
 * Icelandic food, what an oxymoron, at least that burger I had.
 
 * It is actually cold over here. It's -2 at the moment.
 
 * Nobody is amazed that I'm from Iceland. This happens in every other
   country in the world, but not here. What gives?
   
 * The water here is actually good enough that I'll drink it. I have
   to start buying bottled water in Amsterdam.
   
 * I've been reading
   [Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World](http://www.amazon.com/Boomerang-Travels-New-Third-World/dp/0393081818)
   by Michael Lewis on Darren's recommendation. I'm 60% through
   it. The first 1/4 is about the Icelandic collapse, it also covers
   Greece & Ireland. It's the best account of those collapses I've
   read yet. This book really needs an Icelandic translation, but it
   doesn't appear that one exists.
