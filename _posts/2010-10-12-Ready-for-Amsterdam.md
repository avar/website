I'll be starting work with [booking.com](http://booking.com) on
October 18. I'm flying out to Amsterdam tomorrow on October 13.

I'll be in a temporary apartment Booking.com has arranged for me for
the first two weeks while I look for my own place. That's one part of
their excellent relocation package, they've really got the process of
bringing you into Amsterdam nailed down.

I've got everything I need packed into approximately 30L of a single
60L backback. Just cloathing, my laptop and camera. Everything else
I'm either going to rent or buy once I get there.

Wish me luck.
