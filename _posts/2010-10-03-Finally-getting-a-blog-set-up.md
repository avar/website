I've decided to finally set up a website and blog. My
[old website](http://github.com/avar/website/commit/d36f3852f5d) had
been stale for quite a while, I never updated it.

I'm going to try to change that by setting up something that I can
bother to maintain, namely:

 * A Git-based blog where I can write blog posts as markdown
   files. I'm using [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for
   this.

 * Use [disqus.com](http://disqus.com/) to allow user comments. This
   way I can keep the site itself static. I.e. I can just use squid +
   apache, instead of running something like Wordpress.
   
 * Link to
   [my perl blog](http://blogs.perl.org/users/aevar_arnfjor_bjarmason/),
   my
   [OpenStreetMap blog](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/%C3%86var%20Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0%20Bjarmason/diary),
   [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/avarab) and other places where
   I write.
   
To get started with the look I stole the layout from a site in the
[jekyll site list](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites). I'm
probably not going to keep it for long, but design my own simple
look. Something based on the
[Readability](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/) project,
or the [W3C Core Styles](http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/).
